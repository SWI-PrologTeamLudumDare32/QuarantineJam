## Ideas

- A cow's pregnancy lasts about 279 days
- Herds get infected
- Cougar gets into chickens
- Cougar trap
- Offgrid power - windmill, water turbine
- Truck, tractor, fork lift, portable pump, wine press break down
- Pests - locusts, mites, weevils
- Prices of milk/meat/etc rise & fall, marketing
- Upgrade barn
- Weeding, fertilizing (have to buy fertilizer, it's a major expense)
- Fuel
- Weather - hail, blizzard, lack of rain, too much wind
- Somebody left the gate open, animals wander, some onto road and hit
- Farm machinery is dangerous. People die in grain bins
- Most such folks hunt to add meat to the family table
- Provide yur own power, sewer, water, phone, internet
- Plow, harrow, plant, water, fertilize, control weeds, harvest
- If it's a winery, the process has just started - press, blend, barrel age, bottle, sell
- Crops have to be rotated
- Do I store my grain and wait for price to rise or sell it? how much storage do I have?
- barn - a home for horses, cows, pigs, chickens.  A cow/horse barn has animals on the ground floor. 2nd floor is stacked with hay bales.
- Horses - need horses
- Donkeys, oxen, horses are the old way to get power to plow.
- Combine - cuts wheat or corn, and for wheat separates the chaff from the wheat kernel (threshing), stores wheat in bin, farm couple, the guy drives the combine
- The wife drives the farm truck to the elevator, sells the wheat, comes back and gets another load.
- Plow - turn the earth over so it's ready to be planted
- Planter - pulled trainer gizmo that puts the seeds in the ground
- Weed sprayer - sprays chemicals on the crop
