 Gilbert, friday night I'm having HUGE internet issues. It's pretty much proving impossible to get anything done like this,
so I'm going to (try to) check this in and give up for the evening. 

Feel free to get started with whatever. I'm not really having a lot of luck with thinking up prolog oriented 'a lot of'.
So if you get some idea you like, just start coding, when I get up I'll hopefully have better internet and will jump in and help.

## Ideas

The obvious thing is a particle game. But that's both 'what everybody will do' and not very good fit for prolog.

A trading game, where some characters have A LOT OF coal, so they won't trade for coal but will trade for shoes.

We could take my narrative generation (annie-talespin or annies-talespin on the swi-prolog education organization on github)
and make a more fully fleshed narrative generator, using 'A LOT OF' as part of the narrative design.

We could do a 'reduction' game that uses SLD under the surface - start with a bunch of colored shapes. player runs around and picks them
up, like power ups. When certain combos are in inventory, they transform into another thing. This is easy on the server with CHR.

If you pick up the wrong combo you can get to where you can't proceed. Like if you pick up red dot and black star then you
get a black X, and you can't pick up any more black things.

So there's a control so you can 'back up' , undoing the transforms.

Anyway, I'll try to get up as early as possible, so I should be on about 8pm your time and hopefully we can interact.

Sorry about the internet


Annie
